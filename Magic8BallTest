# I tested my final if/else statement by putting empty strings into the Name and Question variable's output and got my if/else statement to function well. 
# The only thing i struggled with was the syntax of my if else statement adapting to powershell structure and often forgetting when to put == vs = 
# I also struggled a bit with putting in  my def when asked to Declare a variable called random_number, and assign it to the function call: random.randint(1, 9)
# This was because I kept trying to overcomplicate it. Simpler was better, and I misread it as writing a def statment like def(call) = random = random.randint(1, 9), which definitely didn't work.
